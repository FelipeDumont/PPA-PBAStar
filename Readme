README

This folder contains the Bash file Test.sh to create a folder Results, that will include the testing of the AStart singlecore, multicore, and Bidirectional multicore approach
The AStar folder contains the implementation of the algorithm, as of now the folder contains a make file to deal with the dll creation of the AStar, that will work only fon linux
since the threading libraries used are from linux, and the threading in windows changes some things.
In the AStar folder there is a bash to test the algorithm, with the building and testing of any configuration.
An example of the use of the bash files are the next

Main folder:
bash Test.sh true
*true or false depending if you will clear and create a new version of AStar to test

AStar folder:
bash Test.sh 0 2 2 50 1 0 0
The input is as follows
1: 0 or 1 depending if you want to rebuild the excecutable
2: 0,1,2 where the numbers reference the modes: singlecore, multicore, bidirectional multicore
3: 2,3 ... n, this number represents the number of threads to excecute the file, please use more than 2
4: 50, 100, n, this is the size of the map, that will be sized as nxn
5: 1,2,3 .. n, this will represent the number of individuals to obtain the path
6: 0,1: the maps to test the algorithm.
7: 0,1: 1 is the debug mode, will display some information in between and present the obtained solutions
